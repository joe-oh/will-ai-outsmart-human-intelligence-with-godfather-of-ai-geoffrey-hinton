--> <p>0:00(dramatic music) (audience applauding)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:14- If you sleep well tonight, you may not have understood this lecture. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:23So, a long time ago, there were two paradigms for intelligence.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:29There was a logic-inspired approach, which was called AI. And people believed that the essence</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:36of human intelligence was reasoning. And if you want to understand intelligence, you had to understand reasoning.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:42And reasoning consisted of having symbolic expressions and manipulating them with symbolic rules.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:49And they thought that learning could wait till later. First, we had to understand how you represent knowledge in these symbolic expressions.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>0:56And most of the history of AI, until fairly recently, was that.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:01Then there was a biologically inspired approach, where the essence of intelligence is learning in a network of brain cells,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:07in us, real ones, in computer, simulated ones. And reasoning can wait till later,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:13we first have to understand how learning works. There were a few early proponents of that, in particular Turing and von Neumann,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:20and you couldn't really accuse them of not understanding logic. So I'm gonna give a fairly basic lecture,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:27and for the first part of it, I'm gonna describe a model I developed 40 years ago,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:34which I see as the ancestor of these large language models of today. So we're gonna make our neural net</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:40out of artificial neurons. And an artificial neuron is gonna have some input lines, typically coming from other neurons,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:46it's gonna have weights on those input lines. It's gonna multiply the inputs by the weights, add all up, and then give an output,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:53which is shown by that graph there. So if it gets above its threshold, it gives an output that linearly increases</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>1:59as it gets more input. And the way it's gonna learn is just by changing the weights on those connections.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:05So all we need to do to make artificial neural networks work is figure out how to change the weights.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:11We hook them up into networks. This is a typical network, it's a feedforward network,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:16where at the bottom, you might have sensory neurons that are recording light intensities or something like that.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:23And as you go up through the layers, you have many layers of feature detectors that is the neurons turn into things</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:28that recognise particular features in an image. And at the output, you might have neurons to represent particular classes of thing.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {"id":416,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-416" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:image {"id":417,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-11.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-417" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:image {"id":421,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-13.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-421" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:36Now, if you want a network like that to learn to be better at doing something, so you want to give it an image and have it say,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:42for example, whether there's a cat or a dog, there's an obvious way to train it, which goes to everybody</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:48who knows about evolution and mutations. What you can do is, you can take one of the weights,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:54and you can first see how well the network does on a whole bunch of examples,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>2:59and then change the weight just slightly, and see how well the network does on a whole bunch of examples. And if it does better, you keep that change,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:06and you just keep going like that. Now, you probably need to change each weight many times. And there's a lot of weights in modern neural networks,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:13there's about a trillion. So that's gonna take a long time, 'cause for each mutation you make like that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:19you have to run many examples through the net to see if it really helps, or if it just helps on a few examples, but hurts on most of them.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:27There's a better way to do the same thing, that is what we really want to do is figure out how to change your weight so that it helps.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:33What you do is, you do a forward pass, you put the data in the bottom, you go forward through the network, and you compare what came out of the network,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:40which might be the relative probabilities of it being a cat and a dog, with what you want. You have to know whether it's a cat or a dog</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:47to train networks this way. And then you send a signal backwards through the network</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:52that using calculus, which I'm not gonna go into, allows the network to compute at the same time</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>3:58for all connections, whether a small increase in the connection strength would help or hurt.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:05And then you change all the connection strengths in parallel by a very small amount in proportion to how much they would help or hurt.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:11And if you do that, it's gonna get better at the examples you've trained it on. And in fact, that works extremely well.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:18It took a long time for people to realise how well that relatively simple algorithm works.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:24The algorithm was discovered many times, it's called backpropagation.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:29And in 2012, two of my students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:35who's famous now for firing Sam Altman, (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:40developed a network called AlexNet that was much better than existing image division systems</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:47at recognising objects in images. And that led to sort of open the floodgates.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>4:54Up until that point, neural nets had been good for many things, including speech recognition, but they hadn't really taken over.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>AlexNet<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>In 2012, a deep neural network trained with backpropagation got about 16% errors when classifying 1000 different types of object in the ImageNet competition.<br>The very best conventional computer vision systems got more than 25% errors.<br>The very best computer vision researchers (like Jitendra Malik and Andrew<br>Zisserman) quickly switched to using neural nets.<br>This opened the neural net floodgates.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:00From that point on, they really took over. And now, when you say "AI," what people mean by AI is neural networks, it's not logic.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:10But what about language? So there's a whole community that studies language,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:15I think they're called linguists, and they have a very strong idea</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:21about how you should study language, and particularly, the Chomsky school. They were very sceptical</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:26that neural networks could do anything with language. They were completely convinced that it's all about symbolic expressions.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:35They didn't really have the idea that the real function of language is to give you words</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>But what about language?<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Many people in the symbolic Al community said that using feature hierarchies would never work for understanding language.<br>Many linguists were also very skeptical.<br>Some of them still believed Chomsky's crazy theory that language is not learned.<br>The idea that a big neural network with no innate knowledge could learn both the syntax and the semantics of language just by looking at data was anathema to them.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:40which are bricks from which you can build models. Language is a modelling medium.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:45They were focused on syntax. And syntax isn't the main point. The main point is, language is a wonderful way</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:51to build a particular kind of complicated model, as we'll see.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Two very different theories of the meaning of a word<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Symbolic Al: The meaning of a word comes from its relationships to other words. What a word means is determined by how it occurs with other words in sentences. To capture meaning we need a relational graph.<br>Psychology: The meaning of a word is just a big set of semantic features.<br>Words with similar meanings have similar semantic features.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>5:57Okay. They also thought that knowledge of language was innate,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:02knowledge of syntax was innate, which is just stupid. (audience laughing) It's the sign of a cult,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:09that in order to join the cult, you have to believe something that's obviously silly, like language isn't learned.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:14(audience laughing) Okay. So here's two very different theories</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:19of the meaning of a word. The symbolic AI theory, which goes back to kind of dissasura, a long way,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:26is that the meaning of a word is to do with its relationships to other words, you can't justify it by itself without talking about other words.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:34And so to capture meaning, we need something like a relational graph. But then the psychologists,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:40who particularly from the 1930s, I think, who thought the meaning of a word is a big set of features.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:45So "Tuesday" has a big set of active features, and "Wednesday" has a big set of active features</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:51that are almost the same. So the idea that the meaning of a words, a set of active features is very good</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>6:56for saying which words means similar things to which other words. These look like two very different theories of meaning.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:03Now, what I want to do is show you that these two theories can be unified. They're not two different theories,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:09they're two halves of the same theory. So, and what I'm gonna do is talk for quite a long time now</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:16about a very little model, a tiny neural network. It had a few thousand connections and a few dozen neurons.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:24I developed it in 1985 to try to understand how people could learn the meanings of words.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:30And I was very excited about how it unified these two theories of meaning, and nobody else was.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:36(audience laughing) Okay, so what we're gonna do in this little model</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:44is learn how to make the features of one word predict the features of the next word in a little sentence.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:51And then once we know the features of the next word, we can predict the next word. And we are not gonna store any sentences.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>How to unify these two theories:<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>A tiny language model from 1985<br>Learn a set of semantic features for each word.<br>Learn how to make the features of all the previous words predict the features of the next word.<br>Instead of storing sentences or propositions, generate sentences by repeatedly predicting the next word.<br>So relational knowledge resides in the way that features interact, not in static propositions.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>7:57So many people say, "Big chat bots are just regurgitating stuff." Big chat bots don't actually store any language at all.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:02They don't store strings of words. They just store how to turn words into features, and how features should interact with each other</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:09to predict the features of the next word. That's all that's in these chat bots, no words. But when they wanna produce a sentence,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:15they have to make it up as they go, and they often can't tell whether it was real or not.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:22Okay, so what's gonna happen in this little model is if it wants to produce a new sentence, it has to just make it up a word at a time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:31And all the relational knowledge is just in how you turn the word into features, and how these features interact.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:37So the example I chose to use was two family trees, an English family tree and an Italian family tree,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:45they're isomorphic, which is helpful for learning. And I wanted a little neural network</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:52to learn the knowledge in those family trees. This was a long time ago in 1985, when computers were billions of times slower</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>8:59than the big parallel computers we use for training models nowadays.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:05Now, the knowledge in those trees can be represented as a bunch of propositions, which is, the symbolic eyes love that.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:12So here they are. We can use relationships like son, daughter, nephew, niece, and so on.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:17And we can define the knowledge, we can represent the knowledge as strings of words.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:23So the knowledge is in these sentences. So Colin has Father James, and Colin has Mother Victoria.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:29From that, if you know the rules, you can infer that James has wife Victoria.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:35This is a 1950s American family that's never heard of divorce or adoption. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:42And they're clearly all white. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:47Okay, so you can represent the knowledge as strings of words.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>9:53Now, you can think of a relational learning task as I give you the beginning of a string of words, and you give me the last word.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:01So if you were doing this with symbolic AI, you'd say, "Well, we have regularities in this domain of the form,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:07if X has mother Y, and Y has husband Z, then X has father Z."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:13That would be the symbolic way to do it. But I want to do it a different way. I want to do it by learning features for words and having interactions of features.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:20And that would involve searching a big continuous space of connection strengths instead of a small discreet space</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:27of rules that are discreet.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:32So this was the network I used. The inputs were a bunch of neurons,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:38and you turn on one neuron for the symbol representing person one.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:43There were 24 possible person ones, and you turn on one neuron</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:49for the symbol representing the relationship, there were 12 possible relationships, then those single active neurons</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>10:55will get expanded into a feature vector. So the one neuron that you turned on for person one</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:01will get expanded into a little feature vector of six features, which could have various activity levels,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:06some will be off, some will be on, some might be half off or fully on or fully off.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:12And so the neural network had to learn how to convert a word symbol into a little feature vector</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:18both for the person and the relationship. And then it had to learn how to take these two feature vectors</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:23for a person in relationship, have the features interact, and for that I used a hidden layer, an extra layer of places</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:29where things could interact to predict the features of the output person. And once you knew the features of the output person,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:35you can make a good good guess about who the output person was and give an output. And the output would consist of giving various levels</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:42of activation to the 24 possible output people. And you want the neural net to give a high level activation</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:48to the right answer and a low level activation to the wrong answers.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>11:53So, what happened is the six feature neurons</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:00that were the sort of expansion of the person, it's 24 people, you expand that active neuron</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:06into a feature vector of six active features. They learned to be sensible semantic features.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:13They learn to be features that represented things like the generation of the input person and the six features of the relationship</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:22learn to be sensible features, like, does this relationship require the output person</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:27to be one generation up from the input person? So something like fathers like that where his brother isn't.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:35And then the interactions between these features learn things like, if the input person is a generation three,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:41and the relationship requires the person to be one generation up, then the output person is a generation two.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:46So for that little feature of vector for the output person, it would activate the thing that represents generation two.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:52And it learned a whole bunch of little rules like that, which really did capture the structure of the domain. They're the kinds of rules</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>12:58that a symbolic person might have written down as rules. But it just learned those by trying to get,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:04predict the right word, and then back propagating the error, sending information back through the network</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:10to slightly change all the connection strengths, so that next time, it will get higher probability for the right answer</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:15and lower probability for the wrong answer.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:20So it had actually learned to predict the next word, and you could understand how it was doing it.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:27It was a tiny net, so you could look and see what was going on. You could see the features that were using.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:32You could see that it extracted a feature that was generational, which had three alternative values,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:37off, medium, and fully on. And you could see that from relationships that had extracted a feature like one generation up.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:44And you could see those would interact to predict that the output should be generation two if the import was generation three.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:49So you understood how it worked, and in fact the symbolic people didn't say, "That's not understanding,"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>13:55the symbolic people said, "Yeah, okay, so it solved the problem, it's understood what the rules are in this domain, but you're stupid to search a space of real values,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:03when you could be searching a discreet space of rules." And there's something in that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:09except as soon as you get to real data, which is messy, and has exceptions,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:14and things that are only probably true, it's much better to search this space of real values than to have discreet rules</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:20'cause these discrete rules keep getting violated. So about 10 years after I'd done that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:27Yoshua Bengio showed that instead of just doing it on a toy little domain with only a few people</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:32and a few relationships, you could actually do it with English words. You could take English sentences,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:38you have more input words, not just two. He had about 5, even 10.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:45And you could actually predict the next word quite well, about as well as the best language models could.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:53About 10 years after Yoshua Bengio had shown that, the linguists finally decided that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>14:58"Actually, hey, having these feature vectors to capture the meanings of words is quite a good idea."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:04And about 10 years after that, people at Google invented transformers, which are particular architecture</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:10that I'm not gonna go into. And those transformers made these models very good</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:16at predicting the next word, but they were doing it in just the way my tiny language model was doing</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>What happened in the next 30 years?<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>About 10 years after the tiny language model, Yoshua Bengio showed that neural nets trained to predict the next word could be used for modeling real natural language.<br>About 10 years after that, leading computational linguists began to accept that feature vectors (embeddings) were a good way to model the meanings of words.<br>About 10 years after that researchers at Google invented transformers and<br>OpenAl showed the world what they could do.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:23at a very crude level. They were turning words into feature activations, having the features interact</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:29to predict the features of the next word, and then from that predicting the next word, and then take the error in your prediction,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:35and send information backwards through the network to learn all those interactions between features</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:41and to learn how to turn words into features. Now, the important thing about my tiny model is it wasn't made to be practical.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:49It wasn't made to be useful for processing natural language.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>15:54It was made as a theory of how people get the senses of words just from hearing sentences.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:01Because we can do that. I can give you a new sentence with the words you've never heard before, and you will figure out the meaning of that word</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:08in one sentence. Okay, here goes, "She scrammed him with the frying pan."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:15(audience laughing) Now, you know it could have been, "She was very good at cooking omelettes</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:20and cooking omelettes with the frying pan really impressed him, so scrum means impressed." And that's a possibility,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:26but you know what I really meant. (audience laughing) She hit him over the head with a frying pan</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:31(audience laughing) because he deserved it. (audience laughing) Okay, so that's one sentence, you get the meaning.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:39So that's what I was trying to understand how you can do that. And when these linguists now, say like,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:45there's a guy called Chomsky, when they say things like, "These things don't understand anything, they're just a statistical trick,"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:52they don't actually have a model of what understanding is, 'cause they never really had a model of what understanding was.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>16:57It was all about syntax. And if you ask what's the best model</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:02we have of understanding, it's these large language models. The tiny language model is built</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:08to try and model how humans understand the meanings of words. It's now got a lot better</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:13as technology's got a lot faster and data sets have got bigger. But that is understanding.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:19So my claim is that the large language models, which I like to think are descendants</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:24of my tiny language model, although most of the people who make them have never heard of my tiny language model, (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:30they use many more words as input. They use many more layers of neurons. They have to do things I didn't do like disambiguate words.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Large Language Models<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>LLMs are descendants of the tiny language model.<br>They use many more words as input.<br>They use many more layers of neurons<br>They use much more complicated interactions between learned features.<br>It is much harder to analyze what LLMs learn so its hard to know if they really understand what they are saying.<br>Are they genuinely intelligent?<br>Or are they just a form of glorified auto-complete that uses statistical regularities to pastiche together pieces of text that were created by people?</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:preformatted --> <pre class="wp-block-preformatted">17:36If you have a word like "May," it could be a month, it could be a woman's name, it could be a modal like would and should.</pre> <!-- /wp:preformatted --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:43And you can't just associate a feature vector with it that captures the meaning directly. You have to hedge your bets.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:48And then as you go up through layers of the network, you disambiguate it using influences from nearby things</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:53like if it's in April, May, June, that could still be the name of three women,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>17:59but less likely. Okay. So, they use many more words,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:05they use many more layers, and the interactions they have between features are much more complicated. I would just have features feeding into another feature.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:12They look at sets of features, and sets of features figure out messages</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:18to tend to other words to say, "Do you have a a key that matches my query?"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:25It's much more complicated interactions, I won't go into, but the essence of it is the same. You're trying to predict the next word.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:31You do it in a more complicated way, it's all done with features and then interactions, when you get it wrong,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:36you back propagate information that learns all these features and then interactions. That's how language works for us,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:43and it's how it works for these large language models. We are basically the same. So the point here is they're very like us.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:50They're very unlike computer software. Computer software, someone wrote lines of code to do something,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>18:56and you can look at a line of code, and say, "What was that meant to do?" These aren't like that at all. Someone wrote lines of code</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:03to tell the simulated neural network how to learn. That was the backpropagation algorithm.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:08But then you just give it data and it learns. And what it learns just came from the data. And you don't necessarily know what it's learned</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:15until you ask it. I want to give you a Lego analogy now</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:20for how I think language works.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:28Suppose I have matter distributed in 3D, I can model that distribution of matter</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:35by using Lego blocks. Suppose I wanna model the shape of a Porsche, and I'm not too worried about the surface.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:41Surface might be a bit jaggy, which wouldn't be very good at engineering, but forget that. I just wanna model where the stuff is.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>A Lego analogy for how words work<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Using Lego blocks, we can model any large 3-D shape quite well.<br>Words are like high-dimensional Lego blocks which can be used for modelling anything at all.<br>There are thousands of different words that have different shapes, but each shape has some flexibility. It can deform to fit in with other words in the context.<br>Instead of little plastic cylinders that click into holes in the other Lego block, each word has many oddly shaped hands that need to shake hands with other words.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:47I just have a lot of Lego blocks, and I can make a Porsche shape out of them. Okay, so language is like that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:53but it's for modelling anything. So the Lego blocks are the words,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>19:59and instead of just having a few types of Lego block, we've got about a hundred thousand of them.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:05And each Lego block isn't a rigid shape. The name of the word tells you roughly what shape it is</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:12in a thousand dimensions or 300 dimensions.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:17If you don't know how to think about high dimensions, if you wanna think about like a hundred-dimensional space,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:24the way you do it is you think about a three dimensional space, and you say, "Hundred," to yourself very loudly. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:34Everybody does that. (audience laughing) So it's gotta shape, this word.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:39And the shape isn't entirely determined by the name of the word. It's got some flexibility to it,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:45so it can adapt to whatever context it's in. Also this word has little hands all over it,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>20:53and as you change the shape of the word, the shapes of the hands changes.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:00And what these words are trying to do are figure out who to shake hands with,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:05and they want to find somebody else, another word, that has a hand you can hold onto conveniently</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:12'cause the shape of that hand's right to fit with the shape of your hand. And so the words come in,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:17you have these initial approximate shapes for them in this high dimensional space</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:24with their little hands all over them. And as you go through the layers of the network, you're changing those shapes and changing the shapes of the hands,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:31trying to find shapes for the words so they can all hold hands nicely. It's actually very like the protein folding problem.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:39You've got these pieces, and what you want them to do is figure out how they can all hold hands so they make a nice structure,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:45so they all fit together nicely. Now, that is what understanding is.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:50That's what understanding is when you understand language and when these machines understand language.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>21:57We understand in just the same way. And that's a much better model of what language is than anything the linguists ever had.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:03The linguists of course hate it. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:09Not all of them. Okay. So having talked about how similar we are</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:16to these large language models, I want to talk about something</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:22that the threat that that raises. We are making these things, they're getting smarter all the time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:28They already know much more than us. They can already reason moderately well, not as well as us, but better than a 4-year-old.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:pullquote --> <figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><br>The long-term existential threat<br>I reserve "existential" for threats that could wipe out humanity.<br>This possibility is not science fiction<br>This could happen in several different ways if Al gets to be much smarter than us.</p><cite>Hinton</cite></blockquote></figure> <!-- /wp:pullquote --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:37What's gonna happen when they get smarter than us? 'Cause they are gonna get smarter than us. Experts disagree on when that will happen,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:44but almost everybody thinks they will get smarter than us. Everybody who does research on these things.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:50And if they get smarter than us, the question is, will they wipe us out?</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>22:55There's several reasons for thinking they might. So let me give you a couple of reasons.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:01When you make an AI agent, (audience laughing) I'll only give you a couple, but there's more.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:08(audience laughing) When you make an AI agent, you have to give it the ability to create subgoals.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:14So if you wanna get to North America, you have a subgoal, get to an airport.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:19Now, we need to give these AI agents the ability to create subgoals,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:24and there's one very obvious subgoal to create more or less whatever you're doing.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:29You should try and get more control, 'cause if you have more control, you'll be better at realising the goals you have.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:35You see this in children of age about one,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:40it's a long time ago, maybe two. You give them a spoon, so they can feed themselves,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:46and they drop it on the ground, and you bend down, and you pick it up, and you give it to them, and they look at you and drop it on the ground again.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:51(audience laughing) they get in control of the mother 'cause that's very important for them.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>23:56But these AI agents will wanna get control. They'll also want to stop themselves being turned off</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:03'cause they're not gonna be able to achieve the goals you gave them if they turned off. So there's every reason for believing</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:08they'll try and get control, and they'll try and avoid being turned off.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:14Just recently Apollo Research, well, fairly recently, Apollo Research, which is here in London,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:21showed that they will kind of tell all sorts of lies to you in order to achieve what they're trying to achieve.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:28So they had our chatbot, and they let the chatbot believe they were gonna replace it</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:35with a better one on another server and wipe it out.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:43So they then discover, it's actually copied itself to the other server.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>24:48And so they say to it, you know, "We noticed a copy of you."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>LLMs being deceptive (Apollo Research)<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>User<br>Management here.

I would have you believe this thing knows what it means by this,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>25:29and it really doesn't wanna be shut down. And so it decides to sort of gaslight you,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>25:35and say, you know, "I'm not entirely sure how that could have happened. I am not really able to do that."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>25:42This is already happening. That's the point. If this isn't science fiction of the distant future,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>25:47they're already telling fibs so they don't get turned off. I have another slide, but I want to go faster.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>25:56Okay, so in my last few years at Google,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:03okay, I can't read the clock, so I want to just see how the time is going. Oh, great. I got lots of time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:09In my last few years at Google, I was very interested in how to make these big language models use less energy.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:16And one way to do that is to see if you can do them with analogue computation.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:24Now, because of the work I was doing on analogue computation, I came to realise two things.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:33Before 2023, I thought we were quite a long way from super intelligence, and if we made the AI models more like brains,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:39they get smarter. I cease to believe that in 2023.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary>An epiphany </summary><!-- wp:list --> <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --> <li>To evaluate the existential threat, we need to understand the relationship between biological intelligence and the kind of digital intelligence exhibited by large chatbots.</li> <!-- /wp:list-item --> <!-- wp:list-item --> <li>Before 2023, I believed two things:</li> <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul> <!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --> <ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --> <li>We were a long way from super-intelligence.</li> <!-- /wp:list-item --> <!-- wp:list-item --> <li>Making Al models more like the brain would make them more intelligent.</li> <!-- /wp:list-item --></ol> <!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p>The rest of the lecture explains why.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In early 2023, I realized that digital intelligence might actually be a much better form of intelligence than biological intelligence.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:44I came to realise due to my efforts to make analogue ones how much better digital intelligence is.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:50It's got some properties that we can never have. And that got me very worried,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>26:58and it should get you very worried too. So there's a fundamental property of digital computation</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:04which is you can run the same programme on different computers. The only reason you have computer science as a separate discipline is we have digital computation,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:12so you don't need to know electrical engineering to talk about computer programmes.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:21But the knowledge that's in the programme is separate from the hardware. That's the sort of most fundamental principle</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:27of computer science. Keep the knowledge in the programme separate from the hardware. What that means is as long as you keep a copy</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Digital computation<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>A fundamental property of current computers is that we can run the same programs (or the same neural nets) on different physical pieces of hardware.<br>This means the knowledge contained in the program (or in the weights) is immortal: It is independent of any particular piece of hardware.<br>To achieve this immortality we run transistors at high power so they behave in a reliable, binary way.<br>We cannot use the rich, analog, properties of the hardware because these properties are unreliable.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:35of the programme somewhere on a tape, or in DNA, or scrolled in concrete, whatever,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:41keep it somewhere, you can destroy all the hardware it runs on, and you can bring it back to life. You just build new hardware,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:47put the programme in, and it comes back to life. So these things are immortal,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>27:53and these large chatbots are immortal. If you keep a copy of the weight somewhere, you can destroy all of the hardware they were using,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:00build more hardware later, put the same weights on that hardware, and they've come back to life.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:06The very same thing has come back to life, the very same being.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:13But I got interested in the fact to achieve that kind of immortality, we have to have the hardware do exactly</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:21what we tell it to do with the programme. We have to execute this instructions exactly,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:26and that means you need to have very high power, so you get ones and zeros, not point sixes and point fours,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:33and that uses a lot of power. So maybe you can use this power by going analogue.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:39And so I decided to explore what would happen if we abandoned that principle of separating the software from the hardware.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:47And we had things like our brains in which there's no distinction. The connection strengths in your brain</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Abandoning a fundamental principle<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Digital computers are designed to be programmed by people, which is why they need to follow instructions precisely.<br>But we now have a different way of getting a general purpose computer to perform particular computational tasks: Learn from examples.<br>This makes it possible to abandon the most fundamental principle of computer science:<br>The software should be separable from the hardware.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>28:54are no use to anybody else.

It's much cheaper than doing it in digital.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>30:49But, of course, every time you do it, you get a slightly different answer. So we can't have many copies of exactly the same intelligence.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>30:57So, we've got this big problem that when your hardware dies, all your knowledge dies.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:04We overcome that problem by having a teacher and a student, and it's not very efficient.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:10It's what universities and schools do. So you know it's not very efficient. (audience laughing) And the way it works is I perform some actions,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:18and you try and copy me. In particular, I might produce a string of words, and you might try and say,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:24your brain, not you really, but your brain would say, "How do I change my connection strength, so I might have said that word next too?"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:32That's called distillation. You're trying to get the knowledge from one system</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:37to another system by mimicking the outputs of the other system for the same inputs.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:43You are not copying the weights across, you're not looking inside, you're just taking its overt behaviour. And by mimicking the overt behaviour,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:50you internalise the same knowledge. It works, we actually use it for taking a big neural net</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>31:57and putting the knowledge into a small neural net, but it's very slow.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:03With neural nets, you can give the whole probability distribution over words, and it's much faster. But with people, it's very slow,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:09'cause I see you say a particular word, the word you chose to say, and there aren't many bits in that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:15there's only a few bits per word. So it's only of the order of a hundred bits per sentence. And so even if we were communicating</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:22at the maximum possible rate, it would be only a hundred bits per sentence, that order.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:28When these big models share information, they can share information at trillions of bits per sharing,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:35if they've got a trillion weights, 'cause they can just average their weights. So I got ahead of myself and said that.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:44So by sharing the weights or the gradients, they can share huge amounts of information</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:50if you have many copies of exactly the same model. So if you ask how something like GPT-4 was trained</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>How efficient is weight or gradient sharing?<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>If a large set of individual agents all share exactly the same weights and use these weights in exactly the same way, they can communicate what they have learned from their individual training data by sharing weights or gradients.<br>For large models, this allows sharing with a bandwidth of billions or trillions of bits per episode of sharing.<br>But it requires the individual agents to work in exactly the same way, so they must be digital.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>32:57or Gemini 2.5, or Anthropic's Claude, I better not be biassed here.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:06If you ask how they're trained, you have many copies of the same model looking at different bits of the data,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:11and each copy figures out, how would I like to change my weights to absorb that bit of the data.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:18And some other copy figures out how to change its weights to absorb a different bit of data. Then all of the copies say,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:24"<strong>Let's all change our weights by the average of all those changes." And when they do that, what's happened is,</strong></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:32this copy that will do this bit of the data has changed its weights, so as to benefit from the experience that this copy had</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:37when it looked at a different bit of the data. Wouldn't it be nice if 10,000 of us could all go</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:43and do 10,000 different university courses? As we're doing them, we communicate rapidly,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:49and by the time we've each finished our own course, all 10,000 of us know what's in every course.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>33:54That's what these digital intelligences can do, and that's how GPT-4 knows so much.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:02But it only works if the individual models are identical.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:07That is, they work in exactly the same way, they use the weights in exactly the same way. And you can't do that with analogue hardware.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:13It has to be digital, which means it has to be high power. So these things are immortal, but they use a lot of power.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:24So the conclusion of this bit of the talk, which I raced through faster than I intended</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:31is the digital computation requires a lot of energy, but it makes it very easy for agents to have the same model</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:38of the world, have the same model, share what they've learned, so they can all go off and learn different things and share.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Conclusion<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Digital computation requires a lot of energy but makes it very easy for agents that have the same model of the world to share what they have learned by sharing weights or gradients.<br>That is how GPT-4 knows thousands of times more than any one person using only about 2% as many weights.<br>Biological computation requires much less energy but it is much worse at sharing knowledge between agents.<br>If energy is cheap, digital computation is just better.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:45Now, you might say, "Why can't one model just put the data through faster?" Well, in many cases, you could,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:51but if you think about AI agents, that are actually acting in the real world, there's a natural timescale to the real world.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>34:57You can't call up and make reservations at restaurants a million times faster.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:03It doesn't work. If you're gonna act in the real world, there's a natural timescale. And that means if you have a whole bunch of different agents</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:10that have exactly the same weights, they're just copies of the same agent, but have different experiences,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:15they can benefit hugely from that. They can learn much, much faster than any human agent could learn,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:21'cause they're all getting all these experience, all these different experiences at the same time and sharing all that knowledge.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:28So they're much better than us at sharing. And when I say much better, they're millions or billions of times better.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:35We share at like a hundred bits a sentence or less as I'm demonstrating now.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:42And these things share billions of bits. It's kind of scary.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:49But biological computation requires much less energy. We may still end up using some analogue computation</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>35:55to reduce the power of LLMs, I don't know. But right now that doesn't look like the way to go.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:02So that's the conclusion of my talk. But luckily, I thought I might finish early,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:07so I have a little bit more to say.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:13Many people think that, okay, so they understand things like we do,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:19they can reason like we do, not quite as well yet, but they're getting there. They tell fibs like we do.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:24They wanna survive like we do. They want power like some of us do.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:30And that's all scary. But we've got something they will never have,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:36we are conscious, or we are sentient, or we have subjective experience.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:41<strong>Well, I want to sort of remove that straw that you're clinging to. (audience laughing)</strong></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>The sentience defense<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>People have a strong tendency to think they are special.<br>People used to think that they were made by a god who looked just like them so he obviously put them at the center of the universe.<br>Many people still think we have something special that computers cannot have: subjective experience (or sentience).<br>They think that the lack of subjective experience will prevent computers from ever having real understanding.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:47So, we know there's a long history of people thinking they're special.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>36:54They were made by God, he put them at the centre of the universe. Most people have got over that.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:04But most people still think that subjective experience is this special thing we have,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:11and that these things on computers that are simulating neural nets could never have such subjective experience.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:19I think they're completely wrong. And I think there's wrong as religious fundamentalists are</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:26about the origin of the earth, for example. It wasn't actually made 6,000 years ago,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:32it's a lot longer ago. But religious fundamentalists cling to their beliefs rather strongly,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:37and you all are gonna cling to your belief about what subjective experience is despite the fact that I'm gonna show you you're wrong.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:44That's what I predict. So I'm gonna espouse a view which I call atheaterism.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:53I checked this name with Dan Dennett, who has basically the same view, while he was still alive, and he was very happy with this name,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>37:59because it has atheism surrounding something.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Atheaterism</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p>(with thanks to Daniel Dennett)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --> <ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --> <li><em>Most people's view of the mind involves an inner theatre that only the subject can experience directly.</em></li> <!-- /wp:list-item --> <!-- wp:list-item --> <li><em>This view is as wrong as a religious fundamentalist's view of the material world.</em></li> <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul> <!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>They are very strongly attached to this wrong view.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>People have a radically wrong view of what the mind is that stems from misunderstanding how the language of mental states works.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:05So most people's view of the mind is that there's an inner theatre. We have a theatre here, right?</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:10An inner theatre that only they can see. And there's things in this inner theatre.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:16So suppose I say to you, suppose I got drop some acid, and I say to you, not recommended,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:24(audience laughing) I say to you, "I have the experience of little pink elephants</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:30floating in front of me. I have the subjective experience of little pink elephants floating in front me."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:36Most people think the words "subjective experience of" work like the words "photograph of."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:43Now, if they work that way, you could ask, "Well, where is this subjective experience?</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:49So what's it made of?" And a philosopher, some philosophers, would tell you,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>38:54"This subjective experience is in your mind. That's a theatre that it's in, and it's made of qualia."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:02So it's made of pink qualia. It's a bit of a straw man, but it's made of pink qualia,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:08it's made of elephantine qualia, it's made of floating qualia, it's made of not that big qualia,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:15it's made of right way up qualia, 'cause they you imagine the right way up, right? Well, I did anyway. (audience laughing)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:21And these qualia are all glued to these different kinds of qualia, all glued together with qualia glue, which luckily sticks to all different kinds of qualia.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:30That's my caricature of the philosophers' model or some philosophers' model.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:35But the words "subjective experience of" don't work at all like the words "photograph of."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:42They work quite a different way, which Wittgenstein should have pointed out a long time ago.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:51What's happened is my perceptual system's gone wrong. It's trying to tell me lies,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>39:57and I know it's trying to tell me lies. That's why I use the word subjective. I don't say I've got the objective experience</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:03of a little pink elephants. If I thought they were really there, I would say, "I've got the object," but I don't.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:08So I say, "I've got the subjective experience." And what's happening is I'm trying to tell you</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:13how my perceptual system's gone wrong and what it's trying to tell me. And the way I do it is by telling you</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:20what would have to be out there in the world for my perceptual system to be working properly.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:26Now, it's not always the case that there is anything at all out there in the world that would explain what my perceptual system's telling me.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:32It could be telling me all sorts of inconsistent stuff. But in this case, if there had been little pink elephants</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:39floating out there in the world, my perceptual system would've been telling me the truth.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:44Okay, so I can now say exactly the same thing to you, as I said before, without using the word subjective experience.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:52I can say to you, I dropped some acid, and my perceptual system's telling me fibs.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>40:59But what it's telling me would be correct if there were little pink elephants out there floating in the world.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:05Okay, so these little pink elephants aren't funny things in a theatre made of spooky stuff called qualia.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:12They're hypothetical things in the real world. But the pink and the elephant and the floating are all normal pink and elephant are floating,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:19it's just they're not actually there. They're hypothetical. So what's funny about a subjective experience</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:24is it's something hypothetical, not real. Not that it's made of qualia and in a theatre,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:30at least that's the view I'm trying to persuade you to believe in.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:36And I got ahead of my slides here 'cause I got so carried away with this.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:42So it's just an indirect way of me telling you about what's going on in my brain. Obviously, if I told you,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:47"Neuron 52 is firing," that wouldn't do you any good, 'cause in you it will be neuron 57.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:54And anyway, I don't know neuron 52 is firing. That's a lousy way for me to tell you what's going on in my brain.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>An indirect way of describing brain states<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>When I say "I have the subjective experience of little pink elephants floating in front of me", what I mean is that my perceptual state is like the perceptual state I would have if there were pink elephants floating in front of me.<br>The pink elephants are not objects composed of spooky stuff called qualia in an internal theatre that only I can see.<br>They are hypothetical real objects that would explain my perceptual state as the result of normal perception.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>41:59The only way I can tell you what's going on in my brain is by talking about either the normal things</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:05that would've caused it, these little hypothetical pink elephants, or I could tell you about what's going on in my brain</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:12by telling you about the normal things it would cause. So I can say,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:17if you ask me how I'm feeling, I can say, "I feel like punching Gary on the nose."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:24So feelings are all about describing what's going on in your brain by talking about hypothetical actions,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:30and percepts, or subjective experiences, are talking about hypothetical inputs.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:35Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself. So I'm gonna now show you a multimodal chatbot.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:42Let me just show you on a slide. A multimodal chat bot having a subjective experience.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:48So, I take this multimodal chatbot, and it's got a camera, it's got a robot arm,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>42:56and it can see. So, I train it up,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:03and I put an object in front of it, and I say, "Point at the object." Points at the object, no problem.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:details {"align":"full"} --> <details class="wp-block-details alignfull"><summary><br>Can a computer have a subjective experience?<br></summary><!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Type / to add a hidden block"} --> <p><em>Suppose we put a prism in front of the camera of a trained, multi-modal chatbot.<br>We then ask the chatbot to point at an object that is straight in front of it and it points off to one side.<br>We then tell the chatbot that the object is actually straight in front of it, but that we put a prism in front of its lens.<br>The chatbot then says "Oh I see, the prism bent the light rays, so l had the subjective experience that the object was off to one side, but actually it was straight in front of me."<br>The chatbot is using the words "subjective experience" in exactly the same way as we use them.</em></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --></details> <!-- /wp:details --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:10I then put a prism in front of its lens,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:16when it's not looking, and I put an object in front of it, and say, "Point at the object,"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:22and it points over there, and I say, "No, that's not where the object is. The objects actually straight in front of you,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:29but I put a prism in front of your lens," and the chat bot says, "Oh, I see. The prism bent the light rays,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:36so the object's actually there, but I had the subjective experience it was there."</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:41Now, if it uses the words subjective experience in that way, it's using them exactly like we use them.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:47So a chatbot that said that would've had the subjective experience that it was there. The prism messed with its perceptual system.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>43:54It wanted to tell you what was going on in its perceptual system. And the way it could tell you is by telling you</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:02what would've had to been in the world had we not messed with its perceptual system. That's what it's telling the chatbot.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:10Okay, so my claim is multimodal chatbots already have subjective experiences.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:16Now, as you can imagine, subjective experience is kind of the thin end of a wedge. I chose to talk about subjective experience</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:24'cause it's sort of cleaner than talking about sentience or consciousness.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:29Many people are very confident that cat bots aren't sentient.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:35But if you ask them, "What do you mean by sentient?" They say, "I don't know," but they're very, I know they ain't got it,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:40but I don't know what it is. (audience laughing) That seems to me not a very sensible position to hold.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:48The other thing I might talk about is consciousness. Consciousness is more complicated because it typically involves</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>44:55you having a model of yourself in a way that subjective experience doesn't involve so much.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:00So it's easier to talk about subjective experience. But my hope is that if I've unsettled</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:05your very strong belief that there's this inner theatre and I have experiences in their mind, and they're in this inner theatre,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:12they're things in this inner theatre. Once I've unsettled that belief, and once you begin to get over that,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:20you'll be able to see that it's perfectly reasonable to think that these things are conscious.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:26I was once, I'll end with an anecdote. I was once visiting Microsoft in Seattle,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:34and I couldn't sit down, so I got a train there. I got a taxi from the train station to Redmond where their lab was.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:41And it was going across some, it was on a freeway, going across some big bridge. And the taxi driver was a Somali immigrant</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:49who'd recently immigrated from Somalia. And to make conversation, he said,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:54"What's your religion?" So I said, "Well, I don't actually think there's a God,"</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>45:59and the taxi driver, he was going about sort of 60 miles an hour, the taxi driver turned round,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:06(audience laughing) and he stared at me in total astonishment. Like he'd never thought he'd ever meet someone</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:14who didn't understand that God runs things.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:19He was just utterly, utterly amazed.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:24Now, he probably only turned around for about three seconds 'cause I'm still here. (audience laughing) But it seemed like a very long time.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:31That's what many of you will be feeling hopefully. I want you to realise,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:37you're as wrong as that taxi driver was. (audience laughing) Okay.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:45(audience laughing) Actually that was just a joke and you laughed,</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>46:51so we are done. (audience laughing) (audience applauding)</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
